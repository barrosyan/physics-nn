## Introduction
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) represent an innovative approach that combines neural networks with the principles of physics to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) and other physical systems. These networks are particularly valuable when analytical solutions are challenging to obtain or unavailable.

In this repository, we showcase the application of PINNs to both diffusion and fluid dynamics problems. We demonstrate how neural networks can be trained to approximate solutions to these problems accurately. By leveraging deep learning, we highlight the potential of PINNs in real-world applications across diverse domains.

## Diffusion Problem
The diffusion problem is a classic physical phenomenon that describes how a quantity (such as temperature, concentration, or energy) spreads through space over time. It is governed by the diffusion equation, which is a partial differential equation. The exact solution of the diffusion problem is calculated and compared to the predictions made by the PINN.

## Fluid Dynamics Problem
The fluid dynamics problem focuses on solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations using the navier-stokes.py script. This script demonstrates the application of PINNs in simulating fluid flow and showcases their potential for complex fluid dynamics problems.

## Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) combine neural networks with the principles of physics to approximate the solutions of complex physical systems. They leverage the power of deep learning to learn the underlying physics from data, making them versatile tools for solving problems in various domains, including fluid dynamics, heat transfer, and materials science.

In this repository, we employ a neural network architecture to approximate the solution to the diffusion problem while satisfying the governing partial differential equation (PDE). The neural network is trained to minimize the error in both the PDE and the data, resulting in an accurate solution to the problem.
