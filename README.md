## Introduction
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) represent a cutting-edge approach that combines neural networks with the principles of physics to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) and other physical systems. These networks are particularly valuable in scenarios where analytical solutions are difficult or impossible to obtain.

In this repository, we demonstrate the application of PINNs to a diffusion problem. We showcase how a neural network can be trained to approximate the temperature distribution in a space over time, based on the diffusion equation. This approach not only provides an accurate solution to the diffusion problem but also showcases the potential of PINNs in a wide range of real-world applications.

## Diffusion Problem
The diffusion problem is a classic physical phenomenon that describes how a quantity (such as temperature, concentration, or energy) spreads through space over time. It is governed by the diffusion equation, which is a partial differential equation. The exact solution of the diffusion problem is calculated and compared to the predictions made by the PINN.

## Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) combine neural networks with the principles of physics to approximate the solutions of complex physical systems. They leverage the power of deep learning to learn the underlying physics from data, making them versatile tools for solving problems in various domains, including fluid dynamics, heat transfer, and materials science.

In this repository, we employ a neural network architecture to approximate the solution to the diffusion problem while satisfying the governing partial differential equation (PDE). The neural network is trained to minimize the error in both the PDE and the data, resulting in an accurate solution to the problem.
